The Onboardable gem is a Ruby module designed to simplify and streamline the
process of managing and navigating through a series of steps or stages within
an application, typically used for user onboarding workflows. By including
the Onboardable module in a class, developers can easily define a sequence
of onboarding steps, handle transitions between these steps, and maintain
the state of the current step in the sequence.

## üîå Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

```shell
bundle add onboardable
```

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

```shell
gem install onboardable
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

First, ensure that the Onboardable gem is installed and properly set up in your
project as per the installation guide provided earlier.

### Basic Configuration

   To incorporate an onboarding process into your Ruby User class, start by
   including the Onboardable module to add onboarding functionality. Then,
   define the onboarding steps with the has_onboarding method, detailing each
   step with helpful tooltips and descriptions. Here's how you can set it up:

   ```ruby
   class User
     include Onboardable

     has_onboarding do
       step 'Create Account', tooltip: 'Minimum 8 characters.'
       step('Verify Email', Class.new { def self.to_hash = { required: true } })
       step 'Complete Profile'
       step 'Introduction Tour', description: 'Get to know your new workspace!'
     end
   end
   ```

### Using the Onboarding Steps

To enhance the guidance for users on how to navigate and manage the
onboarding flow using the Onboardable gem, here's a concise guide that
could be included in the documentation. This guide covers initialization,
navigation, step verification, and completion of the onboarding process.

After defining and accessing the onboarding steps as described
earlier, managed the onboarding process through various controls
that allow step navigation and state verification:

1. **Initialize Onboarding Process**

   Instantiate the onboarding process when a user object is created.
   This sets up the initial step based on the defined onboarding flow.

   ```ruby
   onboarding = User.new.onboarding
   # Initializes the onboarding process for a new user instance
   ```

1. **Navigating Through Steps**

   Navigate through the onboarding steps using the navigation methods provided.
   These methods help in moving forward and backward through the onboarding process.

   - **Next Step**

      Access the next step without changing the current step to preview
      what's next or advance to it, updating the current step status.

      ```ruby
      onboarding.next_step
      # Returns the next step without changing the current step

      onboarding.next_step!
      # Advances to the next step, updating the current step
      ```

   - **Previous Step**

     Similarly, access the previous step to move back without
     making changes or updates to revert to the previous step.

     ```ruby
     onboarding.prev_step
     # Returns the previous step without changing the current step

     onboarding.prev_step!
     # Reverts to the previous step, updating the current step
     ```

1. **Check Step Position**

   Determine whether the current step is the first or the last in the sequence
   to manage UI elements like 'Next' or 'Back' buttons appropriately.

   ```ruby
   onboarding.first_step?
   # Returns true if the current step is the first

   onboarding.last_step?
   # Returns true if the current step is the last
   ```

1. **Monitor Progress**

   Calculate the progress or completion percentage of the onboarding process
   to provide users with an indication of how far they have progressed.

   ```ruby
   onboarding.progress
   # Returns the percentage of onboarding completion
   ```

1. **Access Current Step Details**

   Retrieve details about the current step, which can include the name,
   custom data, and status, to display appropriate information or help
   the user complete tasks associated with the step.

   ```ruby
   onboarding.current_step
   # Returns the current step in the onboarding process

   onboarding.current_step.name
   # Returns the name of the current step

   onboarding.current_step.data
   # Returns the custom data associated with the step or an empty hash if not specified

   onboarding.current_step.status
   # Provides the current status or progress of the step
   ```

1. **Complete the Onboarding Process**

   Once the user reaches the last step and completes it, finalize the
   onboarding process, which might involve setting a user attribute to
   indicate completion or triggering other application logic.

   ```ruby
   # Direct Check Approach
   if onboarding.last_step?
     # Implement finalization processes like updating user attributes
   end

   # Exception Handling Approach
   begin
     onboarding.next_step!
   rescue LastStepError
     # Implement finalization processes like updating user attributes
   end
   ```

1. **Exit the Onboarding Process Early**

   Handle cases where a user decides to discontinue the onboarding
   by attempting to navigate back from the initial step.

   ```ruby
   # Direct Check Approach
   if onboarding.first_step?
     # Implement cleanup or final actions for an orderly exit
   end

   # Exception Handling Approach
   begin
     onboarding.prev_step!
   rescue FirstStepError
     # Implement cleanup or final actions for an orderly exit
   end
   ```

By following these steps, developers can effectively manage and facilitate a
user-friendly onboarding process using the Onboardable gem.

## üõ† Development

1. After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies.
1. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests.
1. Also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
1. To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
1. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`.
1. After, run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version.
